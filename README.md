# Retro Machines
Retro Machines is a website that allows a user to register an account and view arcade/pinball machines, list them, and add items to a "Wishlist".
Retro Machines is an application built with Angular 7 and .NET Core. This app was a collaborative project built by three people who worked to build out the front and back end separately with an API to connect them. Here's a link to the deployed app- <a href="https://retromachines.herokuapp.com/"> Retro Machines </a>.

# How to use the app.
1. Register.
2. Click View All Machines to view products that are already listed.
3. Click create to add a new machine and fill out each section of the form.
4. You should be redirected to the list of machines and see the machine that you've added. You are not able to edit or delete a machine that you did not add.
5. You can click "Add to Wishlist" and then click Wishlist in the navbar to view the items you've added.
6. There's a "Delete" button on the Wishlist after you click it, refresh the page and the item will be gone.
